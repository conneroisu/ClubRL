# ClubRL
A Reinforcement Learning Simulation System for simulating agents and human players into private Club Penguin Servers. A project made in the context of the mineRL simulator for minecraft, but with alternative creative actions expressable by agents or players through use of clothing, speech, and the club penguin island. Uses Houdini, a self-regarded lightning-fast Club Penguin Private Server written in Python 3. The simulator environment is built ontop of Houdini and requires houdini as a dependency.
